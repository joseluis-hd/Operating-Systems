# Batch Processing with Multiprogramming

This Python program simulates batch processing with multiprogramming, automatically generating processes and their parameters using the **random** library. It features a graphical interface built with **Tkinter**, where processes are grouped into batches of five and executed sequentially. Users can interact in real time by pausing, resuming, interrupting, or marking processes as erroneous through keyboard events managed by **pynput**. Additionally, it uses **threading** to run the keyboard listener without blocking the main execution. The interface displays the status of batches and processes, with progress bars and dynamic updates, effectively simulating a controlled and efficient multiprogramming environment.
